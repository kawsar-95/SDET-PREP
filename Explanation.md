Sure! Here's a simple explanation for each function in the code:

1. **isPalindrome**:
   - This function checks if a given string reads the same backward as forward.
   - It compares characters from the start and end of the string moving towards the center.
   - If all characters match, it returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.

2. **reverseString**:
   - This function reverses a given string.
   - It starts from the end of the string and adds each character to a new string.
   - The result is the original string reversed.

3. **fibonacci**:
   - This function generates the Fibonacci sequence up to the n th number.
   - The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.
   - It returns an array of the first n Fibonacci numbers.

4. **factorial**:
   - This function calculates the factorial of a given number n.
   - The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers up to that number.
   - It multiplies numbers from 1 to n and returns the result.

5. **largestNumber**:
   - This function finds the largest number in an array.
   - It iterates through the array and keeps track of the largest number found.
   - It returns the largest number.

6. **isPrime**:
   - This function checks if a given number n is a prime number.
   - A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - It returns `true` if the number is prime; otherwise, it returns `false`.

7. **countVowelsConsonants**:
   - This function counts the number of vowels and consonants in a given string.
   - It iterates through the string and checks each character to see if it is a vowel or consonant.
   - It returns an object with the counts of vowels and consonants.

8. **sortArray**:
   - This function sorts an array of numbers in ascending order.
   - It uses a simple sorting algorithm to compare and swap elements.
   - It returns the sorted array.

9. **mergeArrays**:
   - This function merges two arrays into one.
   - It adds all elements from the first array to a new array, then adds all elements from the second array.
   - It returns the merged array.

10. **secondLargestNumber**:
    - This function finds the second largest number in an array.
    - It keeps track of the largest and second largest numbers while iterating through the array.
    - It returns the second largest number.

11. **removeDuplicates**:
    - This function removes duplicate values from an array.
    - It iterates through the array and adds each unique value to a new array.
    - It returns the array with duplicates removed.
